DEV-CLUB
i think the Dev club is mainly to provide an environment of developing programs, apps for solving problems of the world.\
as the name suggests it should focus mainly of development of apps including web development. since i am fond of coding
i hope it is going to be a fantastic experience for me to work with this club. this club should have brilliant seniors
who are passioned about developing programs and will guide us in this journey.the club should also participate in 
various competitions regarding web development and coding. they organize lectures and seminars to cater our needs. 
i hope this is going to be very chill.
